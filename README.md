# Independent Cricket Project

Disclaimer: This is a personal project I have been working on for some time, and so was developed as a private repository. I am currently in the process of updating this README file and adding docstrings to relevant code to make this more suitable as a public repository.

# Summary

Uses ball-by-ball data from cricsheet.org to obtain the frequency of outcomes (runs, wickets or extras). These frequencies are counted for different scenarios based on the inning, batter and bowler for example. New matches with artificial players can then be simulated where the outcome of each ball is determined by sampling from the stored data as different discrete distributions. Once the match has been run, various scorecards can be viewed.
