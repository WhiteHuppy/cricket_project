# Independent Cricket Project

Uses ball-by-ball data from cricsheet.org to obtain the frequency of outcomes (runs, wickets or extras). These frequencies are counted for different scenarios based on the inning, batter and bowler for example. New matches with artificial players can then be simulated where the outcome of each ball is determined by sampling from the stored data as different discrete distributions. Once the match has been run, various scorecards can be viewed.
