# Independent Cricket Project

Uses ball-by-ball data from cricsheet.org to obtain the frequency of outcomes (runs, wickets or extras). These frequencies are counted for different scenarios based on the inning, batter and bowler for example. These frequencies are then used to simulate new matches with artificial players where the outcome of each ball is determined by sampling from the stored data as different discrete distributions. Once the match has been run, various scorecards can be viewed.
